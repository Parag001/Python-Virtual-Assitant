# Python Based Virtual Assistant


### Overview:-
*There are total 8 complete coded files of python which is used to build the assistant.There is one file (Assistant-Complete.py) which is the final file that I have created.*

*The one thing that motivated me to build these project is the GOOGLE ASSISTANT.Thats why created my own assistant.*


### Installation:-
*To Work with these code you should have following dependencies installed on python2 or python3:

-wxPython

-wikipedia

-wolframalpha(After installation you should do SignUp to get the API key)

-Install the setup file in repository so that your assistant can speak.After installation add its path to Environment Variables/PATH

-After installation of all dependencies add the API key to the files where i have mentioned (YOUR_API_ID)*


### Reference:-
*-Wikipedia

-Wolframalpha

-Google Speech Recognition*


### I would love if any make it better by modifying it.
